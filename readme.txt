As such, we have created a central Main() which calls to other files as needed.

To proceed, please modify which code you would like to run using launchpad.cs

Comment out anything you do not want to run. 

All files are otherwise self contained. The various xMain() files can be converted to a proper main, 
and launched as an independent executable file if you are inclined to do so. 

Reach out to Andrew W. for any questions / comments on code.
